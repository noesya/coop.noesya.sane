        <p>The aim of this study is to understand on the one hand how organisations might align with non-growth narratives and on the other hand where influences for such an alignment might stem from. Further, we hope to highlight what struggles organisations face due to a non-growth alignment in a world dominated by the imperative of continued economic growth. With this we hope to shed light on what the barriers and enablers are for organisations in helping to achieve a sustainable society.</p>
